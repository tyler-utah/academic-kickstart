# About

<i> I am excited to announce that I will be starting Fall of 2020 at
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) as an Assistant Professor
in Computer Science! </i>

I am a Post Doc researcher at Princeton University working in <a
href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mrm/"> Margaret Martonosi</a>'s
group. My research interests are in concurrency: programming,
modeling, testing, and architecture. In particular, I am interested
in exploring new heterogeneous architectures and how programming models
can enable development of secure and efficient applications.

I am working on the <a href="http://decades.cs.princeton.edu/">
DECADES </a> project which is funded as part of the software defined
hardware (SDH) project.

My previous research focused on GPU programming, namely modeling
the semantics of fine-grained thread interactions and using these
insights to provide efficient and portable synchronisation idiom
implementations.

I received my PhD from the <a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/">
Multicore Programming Group </a> at Imperial College London supervised
by Alastair Donaldson. Previously, I worked with Ganesh Gopalakrishnan
and Zvonimir Rakamaric at University of Utah. I have done internships
at Microsoft Research and Nvidia.
